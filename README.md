# Anomaly Detection of Spinach Adulterated Pistachios using an Autoencoder Architecture
This project focuses on identifying spinach-adulterated pistachios using an autoencoder architecture. By training on pure pistachio images, the autoencoder is designed to detect anomalies, i.e., adulterated pistachios, using reconstruction errors.
