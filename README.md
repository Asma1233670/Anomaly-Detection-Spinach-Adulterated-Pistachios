This project focuses on identifying spinach-adulterated pistachios using an autoencoder architecture. By training on pure pistachio images, the autoencoder is designed to detect anomalies, i.e., adulterated pistachios, using reconstruction errors.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images of pistachios, categorized into:
* **Pure Pistachios:** Images of pure, unadulterated pistachios.
* **Spinach-Adulterated Pistachios:** These are further divided into subsets based on spinach content:
    * 10% spinach adulteration
    * 20% spinach adulteration
    * 30% spinach adulteration
    * 40% spinach adulteration
    * 50% spinach adulteration
